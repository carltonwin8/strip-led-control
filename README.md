The test LED circuit between the signals LED+ and LED- will be replaced
with LED strip once the circuit and software has been debugged and working.

## Implementation Plan

All phases not shown are done.

### Phase 3

Once [Phase 2] is operational solder down the components on a plated through
hole board and verify the circuit works with the test LED setup shown in the
schematics.

### Phase 4

Replace the LED test setup and verify the circuit board works the LED strip.

### Phase 5

Write software to allow Internet control of the board.
